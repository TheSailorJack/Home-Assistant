This Procedure was distilled down from the thread here:

https://community.home-assistant.io/t/python-3-6-upgrade-of-a-virtualenv/21722

and it generally worked for me using Hassbian 1.2 in March 2018

##########

#Upgrade to Debian Stretch (9) if you haven't already (Optional)

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
$ sudo sed -i 's/jessie/stretch/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
$ sudo reboot

--

#Update Python dependencies

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential tk-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline6-dev libdb5.3-dev libgdbm-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev

--

#Download and install latest python

$ cd /home/pi
$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/Python-3.6.3.tgz
$ tar xzvf Python-3.6.3.tgz
$ cd Python-3.6.3/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

#After the above you should have python 2.7, python 3.4 and python 3.6 installed.

--

#re-activate the current home assistant virtual environment (might not have been de-activated yet…)

$ cd /srv/homeassistant

$ sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant 
$ source /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate

#with the home assistant virtual environment active and from the home assistant home directory

$ cd /home/homeassistant
$ pip3 freeze —local > requirements.txt

#This generates a file with the versions of all the packages you have installed. It can be used later to re-install all those packages.
#Check this file and make sure it looks ok
#deactivate the ha virtual environment

$ deactivate

--

#Delete old virtual environment

$ cd /srv/
$ sudo rm -r *

--

#Create new virtual environment with latest python

$ cd /srv/
$ sudo mkdir homeassistant
$ sudo chown homeassistant:homeassistant homeassistant
$ sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
$ cd /srv/homeassistant
$ python3.6 -m venv .
$ source bin/activate

--

#Install latest Hass

$ pip3 install homeassistant
$ hass

--

#with the new virtual environment active do the following checks.

$ python --version
$ python3 --version
$ pip3 --version

#all three should indicate python3.6

--

#go to the home assistant home directory

$ cd /home/homeassistant

#Now we use the requirements.txt file we captured earlier.

$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

#This should install all the packages that were installed in the old virtual environment.
#The openzwave items gave me a problem installing. I commented out the following items. Try installing with them in, you may have better luck than me.

#libopenzwave==0.3.2 
#openzwave==0.3.2
#pyozwman==0.3.2
#pyozwweb==0.3.2

#If it fails on any of these, just comment it out, and run the pip3 install -r requirements.txt again. It will try to re-install the ones it has already done, but it doesn’t do any harm.
#It may take a few attempts commenting out the openzwave items to get through, but eventually the package collection will finish and installation will start.

$ sudo reboot

--

#my browser came up but i had invalid components for zwave, discovery and zeroconf so I’m going to try installing them manually

$ pip3 install zeroconf

#this seems to have taken care of discovery too.

--

#z-wave gave me a problem. So, with the virtualenv active

$ sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

#then

$ pip3 install python_openzwave
$ sudo reboot
